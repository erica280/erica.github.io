        <p id="Description">
        My journey first began in the world of film because I love expressing new
        perspectives on ordinary things. I then transitioned into the Environmental
        Design program at the University of Colorado Boulder because I took interest
        in designing for a more sustainable future. My studies in architecture have
        lead me through a series of explorations that have driven me to become
        invested in designing meaningful and thoughtful spaces that enhance the
        everyday experience. Through film, design, or architecture, as long as I
        am creating and working towards some kind of positive social change, I am happy.
