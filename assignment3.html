    <h3> Overview </h3>
    <p> Kiwi (/ˈkiːwiː/ KEE-wee) are flightless birds endemic to New Zealand of the genus Apteryx (/ˈæptərɪks/)
    and family Apterygidae (/ˌæptəˈrɪdʒədiː/). Approximately the size of a domestic chicken, kiwi are by far
    the smallest living ratites (which also include ostriches, emus, rheas and cassowaries).DNA sequence
    comparisons have yielded the surprising conclusion that kiwi are much more closely related to the
    extinct Malagasy elephant birds than to the moa with which they shared New Zealand. There are five
    recognised species, four of which are currently listed as vulnerable, and one of which is
    near-threatened. All species have been negatively affected by historic deforestation but currently the
    remaining large areas of their forest habitat are well protected in reserves and national parks.
    At present, the greatest threat to their survival is predation by invasive mammalian predators. The
    kiwi's egg is one of the largest in proportion to body size (up to 20% of the female's weight) of any
    species of bird in the world. Other unique adaptations of kiwi, such as their hairlike feathers, short
    and stout legs, and using their nostrils at the end of their long beak to detect prey before they
    ever see it, have helped the bird to become internationally well-known. The kiwi is recognised as an
    icon of New Zealand, and the association is so strong that the term Kiwi is used internationally as the
    colloquial demonym for New Zealanders.

  <h3> Etymology </h3>
    <p> The Māori language word kiwi is generally accepted to be "of imitative origin" from the call.
        However, some linguists derive the word from Proto-Nuclear Polynesian *kiwi, which refers to Numenius
        tahitiensis, the bristle-thighed curlew, a migratory bird that winters in the tropical Pacific
        islands. With its long decurved bill and brown body, the curlew resembles the kiwi. So when the
        first Polynesian settlers arrived, they may have applied the word kiwi to the new-found bird.[11]
        The word is usually uncapitalised when used for the birds. The plural is either the anglicised
        kiwis or, consistent with the Māori language, appearing as kiwi without an ‑s.

        The genus name Apteryx is derived from Ancient Greek 'without wing': a- (ἀ-), 'without' or 'not';
        ptéryx (πτέρυξ), 'wing'.
