    <h3 id="Overview"> Overview </h3>
    <p> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kiwifruit">Kiwi </a>(/ˈkiːwiː/ KEE-wee) are flightless birds
        endemic to New Zealand of the genus Apteryx (/ˈæptərɪks/)and family Apterygidae (/ˌæptəˈrɪdʒədiː/).
        Approximately the size of a domestic chicken, kiwi are by far the smallest living ratites (which
        also include ostriches, emus, rheas and cassowaries).DNA sequence comparisons have yielded the surprising
        conclusion that kiwi are much more closely related to the extinct Malagasy elephant birds than to the moa
        with which they shared New Zealand. There are five recognised species, four of which are currently listed
        as vulnerable, and one of which is near-threatened. All species have been negatively affected by historic
        deforestation but currently the remaining large areas of their forest habitat are well protected in reserves
        and national parks. At present, the greatest threat to their survival is predation by invasive mammalian predators. The
        kiwi's egg is one of the largest in proportion to body size (up to 20% of the female's weight) of any
        species of bird in the world. Other unique adaptations of kiwi, such as their hairlike feathers, short
        and stout legs, and using their nostrils at the end of their long beak to detect prey before they
        ever see it, have helped the bird to become internationally well-known. The kiwi is recognised as an
        icon of New Zealand, and the association is so strong that the term Kiwi is used internationally as the
        colloquial demonym for New Zealanders.

  <h3 id="Etymology"> Etymology </h3>
    <p> The Māori language word kiwi is generally accepted to be "of imitative origin" from the call.
        However, some linguists derive the word from Proto-Nuclear Polynesian *kiwi, which refers to Numenius
        tahitiensis, the bristle-thighed curlew, a migratory bird that winters in the tropical Pacific
        islands. With its long decurved bill and brown body, the curlew resembles the kiwi. So when the
        first Polynesian settlers arrived, they may have applied the word kiwi to the new-found bird.
        The word is usually uncapitalised when used for the birds. The plural is either the anglicised
        kiwis or, consistent with the Māori language, appearing as kiwi without an ‑s.

        The genus name Apteryx is derived from Ancient Greek 'without wing': a- (ἀ-), 'without' or 'not';
        ptéryx (πτέρυξ), 'wing'.

  <h3 id="Taxonomy and systematics"> Taxonomy and Systematics</h3>
    <p> Although it was long presumed that the kiwi was closely related to the other New Zealand ratites,
        the moa, recent DNA studies have identified its closest relative as the extinct elephant bird of
        Madagascar, and among extant ratites, the kiwi is more closely related to the emu and the
        cassowaries than to the moa.

        Research published in 2013 on an extinct genus, Proapteryx, known from the Miocene deposits of the
        Saint Bathans Fauna, found that it was smaller and probably capable of flight, supporting the
        hypothesis that the ancestor of the kiwi reached New Zealand independently from moas, which were
        already large and flightless by the time kiwi appeared.

  <h3 id="Species"> Species</h3>
    <p> There are five known species of kiwi, with a number of subspecies.
